Most successful techniques for regression testing integrate multiple 
sources of information to select the most
promising test cases that can detect bugs. The most effective of these algorithms have 
long running times and often require dynamic or static code analysis, 
making them unsuitable for modern software development environment
where the rate of software delivery could be less than a minutes. 
As a result, the collected data of these
algorithms that are stored in static databases can easily become outdated. 
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, SANI, that is as effective as the
common techniques, while eliminates necessity of the code coverage collection. 
Our approach implements an indexing system that provides tractability 
links between test cases, source code, and code changes. 
Our indexing system uses test scripts, source code, 
and program change history information to develop a test case
prioritization technique. 
Our empirical evaluation with four open source
programs shows that SANI is fast enough to predict the links
among code changes and test cases and increases regression fault
detection rate, comparing to common prirotization techniques.
